=harpoon= skewers the monotony of hooking into (mainly language) major
modes by providing a simple =use-package=-like macro.

It grew out of my [[https://github.com/Walheimat/wal-emacs][configuration]] and therefore is currently still
heavily geared towards packages I use (like =corfu= and =lsp-mode=). But I
aim to slowly decouple its functionality from any particular package.

** Installation

If you use =straight= or =quelpa=, you know what to do.

If you're on Emacs >29, I recommend using =package-vc-install=.

Alternatively, provided you have Cask, you can install the package
with =make install=.

** Usage

Please have a look, again, at my [[https://github.com/Walheimat/wal-emacs][configuration]] for usage examples.
